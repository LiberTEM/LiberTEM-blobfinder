Strain map of a transistor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example shows a typical strain map of a transistor with monocrystalline strained silicon.

Strain map of polycrystalline materials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LiberTEM allows to segment a scan into regions of interest to process grains
with different orientations and lattice parameters separately. This example uses
clustering of a feature vector to process a polycrystalline sample in a fully
automated fashion.
