LiberTEM-blobfinder can evaluate the position of convergent beam electron
diffraction disks or precession electron diffraction peaks to generate input
data for strain maps in three automated steps:

1. Identify peaks using :meth:`~libertem_blobfinder.common.correlation.get_peaks`
2. Extract a probable lattice from the peak positions using
   :meth:`libertem_blobfinder.common.fullmatch.FullMatcher.full_match`
3. Refine the lattice for each frame using :meth:`~libertem_blobfinder.udf.refinement.run_refine`

The algorithms are currently focused on the initial data extraction step, i.e.
they work purely in pixels in frame coordinates and derive only parameters for
each individual peak and for a 2D lattice in the detector reference frame. They
don't try to index peaks in crystallographic indices of the sample or to derive
a 3D orientation. However, they can extract relevant input data such as peak
positions and intensities very efficiently for such subsequent processing steps.

The algorithms are designed to be robust against intensity variations across a
diffraction disk, between disks and between frames by calculating a correlation
for each potential peak position, measuring the quality of each correlation and
using the quality and position with subpixel refinement in a weighted least
square optimization to derive the parameters for each frame. At the same time,
the algorithms are optimized for efficiency and scalability so that they
generate a full strain map on 32 GB of raw data within a few minutes on a
suitable workstation and scale on a cluster, making full use of LiberTEM's
distributed processing capabilities.

Relevant input parameters are

* Matching template
    * Instance of :class:`~libertem_blobfinder.common.patterns.MatchPattern`
    * Available options are :class:`~libertem_blobfinder.common.patterns.RadialGradient`,
      :class:`~libertem_blobfinder.common.patterns.BackgroundSubtraction`,
      :class:`~libertem_blobfinder.common.patterns.RadialGradientBackgroundSubtraction`, and
      :class:`~libertem_blobfinder.common.patterns.UserTemplate`
    * :code:`search` parameter to define the search area around the expected position
* Matcher: Instance of :class:`libertem_blobfinder.common.gridmatching.Matcher`.
    * :code:`tolerance` for position errors in the matching routine
* Number of disks to find in the initial step

See :ref:`examples` for practical application!
